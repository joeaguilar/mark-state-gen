      IWGI Marketing Statement Generator

 IWGI is a fictious company, invented by myself as an aparatus
 to employ my critique not on the businss world,
 but on the business of the business world.

 A marketing statement is often "performed" at a meeting
 of other individuals (investors or clients) in an effort
 to proclaim that the money spent on the marketing team
 is money well spent for the company and that the progress
 of whatever project is still running smoothly.

 Philisophically in line with W.C. Fields' statement
 "If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit".
 The statement is frivolous, formulaic, and idiomatic.

 The words extrapolate patterns into a template that are then
 intermingled with a random selection of niche words to give it
 that "sink or swim" polish. It must be said however, that the
 strategies employed by employed artist follow a similar tactic
 to ensure the continuity of their current project. To say these
 statements are unecessary might be true if one holds the values
 of trust and faith, however more often is the case unnecessary
 statements like these are needed much in the same way the art
 they may be representing is unneeded. And as a proclaimer of
 unnecessary statements, objects, and images,
 these statements are an art.
